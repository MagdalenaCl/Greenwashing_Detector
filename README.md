# Greenwashing_Detector

The task of the Greenwashing Detector is to automatically detect greenwashing by companies in the automotive industry. The companies are classified according to a traffic light system:
- green: no greenwashing
- yellow: vague statements available
- red: greenwashing

The classification is carried out using a large language model and visualized in a dashboard.

The CRISP DM process is used to develop the detector.
